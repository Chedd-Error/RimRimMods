			<description>An organic, firefoam pod produced by giant insects. When it senses fire, the pod pops and sprays a fire-retardant foam in a circular field around itself. Can also be triggered manually. It seldom requires maintenance and lasts for around 20 days before popping even if left completely unmaintained.</description>
