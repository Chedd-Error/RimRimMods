	<description>This little patch changes a couple of values around, largest of them being the jelly morpher. Instead of being straight up better than an empress in terms of jelly production, it is now significantly weaker; it's only benefit is how soon it starts producing, maybe food consumption too.
	
This wouldn't be complete without the other patches, would it? Tendrillmoss gains a signficant buff, and, if it stays, the Silverfish is also gaining a chitin buff: 20 chitin every five days. Hope this is worth the morpher nerf!</description>
